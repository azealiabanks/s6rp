<h1 align="center">Hello World!</h1>
<p align="center">Hello, I'm Sarp. I don't code stuff but I hope to change that soon. I'm mostly interested in Front-End Web stuff, but I'm hoping to get into coding/programming *one day...*</p>

<h1 align="center">Why I Use GitHub</h1>
<p align="center"> No one really cares about this part but I use GitHub to store my web folders and acess the code easily. I'm still new to it but I hope to get used to it one day.
Other than that, I just use it to find sexy code ╰(*°▽°*)╯ </p>

<h1 align="center"> Thanks For Reading This!</h1>
<p align="center"> This is pretty much all, I'll update this once I start doing something good for society. You will most likely find HTML files here but who knows, that might change one day :winkyface:. If you want to contact me, you can check <a style="color: purple;" href="https://s6rp.github.io/-/">my site here.</a>
